Trend Scoring Algorithm Overviewï¼š
Objective: To calculate a composite trend score for S&P 500 stocks, quantifying the strength and direction of the prevailing trend based on technical indicators, and normalize the score for ranking.I. Core Indicator Dimensions & Scoring Concepts:The algorithm generates a raw score based on the latest status of the following five technical indicators:Moving Averages (MA Score):Concept: Evaluates the relationship between the stock's price, its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA50), and its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA200). Points are awarded based on classic trend confirmations (e.g., Price > SMA50 and SMA50 > SMA200 indicating a strong uptrend) or potential reversals.Purpose: To identify the primary trend direction (medium vs. long-term) and the price's position relative to it.MACD (MACD Score):Concept: Assesses the position of the MACD line relative to both the Signal line and the zero line (using standard 12, 26, 9 parameters). Points reflect bullish/bearish momentum strength and potential crossovers.Purpose: To gauge trend momentum and identify potential shifts.ADX (ADX Score):Concept: Scores based on the ADX(14) value and the relationship between the Positive Directional Indicator (+DI or DMP_14) and the Negative Directional Indicator (-DI or DMN_14). A score is assigned only if ADX > 25 (indicating a trending market), with the sign determined by whether +DI or -DI is dominant.Purpose: To measure the strength of the trend (filtering out non-trending markets) and confirm its direction.RSI (RSI Score):Concept: Assigns points based on whether the RSI(14) value is above a bullish threshold (e.g., 55) or below a bearish threshold (e.g., 45). Neutral readings receive zero points.Purpose: To provide secondary confirmation of bullish or bearish momentum.OBV (OBV Score):Concept: Compares the latest On-Balance Volume (OBV) value to its own Simple Moving Average (period defined in config, e.g., 20-day). Points are assigned based on whether OBV is trending above or below its average.Purpose: To incorporate volume flow for trend confirmation; rising OBV relative to its average supports an uptrend.II. Final Score Calculation:Weighted Raw Score: The individual raw scores from the five indicators above are summed using weights specified in the config_trend.ini file (w_ma, w_macd, w_adx, w_rsi, w_obv).Normalization (Normalized_Trend_Score): The resulting Weighted_Raw_Score for all stocks is then normalized using Min-Max Scaling to produce a final score between 0 and 100. Higher scores indicate a stronger composite uptrend according to the model's inputs and weighting.Note: This score provides a quantitative snapshot based on historical price and volume data. Indicators have inherent lag. The score should be considered alongside other analytical methods and does not constitute investment advice.
