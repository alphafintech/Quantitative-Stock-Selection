Fundamental Growth Scoring Algorithm Overview:
Objective: To assess the growth potential and quality of S&P 500 companies by calculating a composite fundamental score for ranking purposes.I. Core Indicator Dimensions & Calculation Concepts:The algorithm evaluates companies based on the following key financial dimensions:A. Growth DimensionRevenue CAGR (Revenue_CAGR):Concept: Calculates the compound annual growth rate of historical annual revenue over the last N+1 available data points (where N is typically 3 or 5 years, defined in config). Uses the actual period covered by available data if less than N years of growth can be calculated.Purpose: Measures the historical average annual top-line growth rate.EPS CAGR (EPS_CAGR):Concept: Calculates the compound annual growth rate of historical annual diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) over the last N+1 available data points. Uses the actual period covered by available data. Returns NaN if starting EPS is non-positive.Purpose: Measures the historical average annual growth rate of profitability per share.Revenue Momentum (Slope_Revenue):Concept: Calculates the slope of the linear regression line fitted to the most recent (up to 4) valid quarterly revenue growth rates (QoQ percentage change). Replaces infinite growth rates with NaN before regression.Purpose: Assesses the recent acceleration or deceleration trend in revenue growth.EPS Momentum (Slope_EPS):Concept: Calculates the slope of the linear regression line fitted to the most recent (up to 4) valid quarterly EPS growth rates (QoQ percentage change). Handles zero/negative prior-quarter EPS based on config. Replaces infinite growth rates with NaN.Purpose: Assesses the recent acceleration or deceleration trend in profitability growth.B. Profitability & Efficiency DimensionTTM Operating Margin Level (TTM_OpMargin_Level):Concept: Calculated as Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) Operating Income divided by TTM Revenue. Requires 4 consecutive valid quarters of both op_income and revenue data for calculation.Purpose: Measures core business profitability over the past year.TTM Return on Equity Level (TTM_ROE_Level):Concept: Calculated as TTM Net Income divided by the average Shareholder Equity over the past 5 quarters. Requires 4 valid quarters of net_income and 5 valid quarters of equity data.Purpose: Measures the efficiency of using shareholder equity to generate profit over the past year.C. Cash Flow DimensionAnnual FCF Growth Slope (Annual_FCF_Growth_Slope):Concept: Calculates the slope of the linear regression line fitted to the last N+1 available years of annual Free Cash Flow (FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures).Purpose: Measures the growth trend in the company's ability to generate discretionary cash flow.D. Financial Health Dimension (Used for Screening Only)Debt-to-Equity Ratio (Latest Quarter):Concept: Calculated as Latest Quarter Total Debt divided by Latest Quarter Equity.Purpose: Measures financial leverage risk. Used to potentially filter out highly leveraged companies.Interest Coverage Ratio (TTM):Concept: Calculated as TTM Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) divided by TTM Interest Expense. Requires 4 valid quarters of both ebit and interest_exp. Special handling for zero/negative interest expense.Purpose: Measures the ability to cover interest payments. Used to potentially filter out companies with high debt servicing risk (current code ignores NaN ICR values during screening).II. Scoring & Ranking Process Outline:Calculate Indicators: Compute all raw indicators listed above for each company based on data retrieved from the database.Screening (Optional): Filter out companies failing financial health checks (Debt-to-Equity, Interest Coverage Ratio) based on configuration thresholds.Standardization: For companies passing the screen, convert the core performance indicators (CAGRs, Slopes, TTM Margin/ROE, FCF Slope) into percentile ranks (0-100) relative to peers ('overall' or by 'industry').Composite Score:Impute any missing standardized scores with 50 (median).Calculate fused growth scores (combining CAGR and Slope scores for Revenue and EPS using weights).Calculate the final Overall_Score by applying weights (from config) to the fused growth scores and the standardized scores for Profitability, Efficiency, and Cash Flow.Reset scores to NaN for companies that failed the initial screening.Ranking: Rank companies based on the final Overall_Score (descending).Note: The final score reflects a blend of historical growth (CAGR), recent momentum (Slopes), profitability/efficiency levels (TTM Margin/ROE), and cash flow trends (FCF Slope), adjusted for peer-relative performance through percentile ranking. Financial health metrics are used solely for initial screening.
