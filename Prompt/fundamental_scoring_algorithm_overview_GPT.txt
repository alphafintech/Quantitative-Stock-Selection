OBJECTIVE  
Evaluate every S&P 500 company on five dimensions—Growth, Quality, Efficiency, Safety, and Valuation—then combine them into a single Total Score (0-100) and a star rating.

I. CORE METRICS AND HOW EACH IS CALCULATED  

Growth metrics are measured two ways:  
• “FY” looks at the last two annual reports and averages the year-over-year percentage changes.  
• “Q-Seq” looks at the last four quarters and averages the quarter-over-quarter percentage changes.  
If a value changes from zero or negative to positive, its growth rate is set at plus one hundred percent.

A. GROWTH  
1. Revenue growth – percentage change in total revenue.  
2. EPS growth – percentage change in diluted EPS (if EPS is missing, use net income divided by shares outstanding).  
3. Free-cash-flow growth – percentage change in free cash flow, where free cash flow equals operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.  
4. Gross-margin change – change in gross profit as a proportion of revenue.  
(The FY and Q-Seq scores for each of these four items are later blended 40 % FY, 60 % Q-Seq.)

B. QUALITY  
5. ROIC – operating income after an assumed 21 % tax charge divided by invested capital.  
6. ROE – net income divided by shareholders’ equity.

C. EFFICIENCY  
7. Operating-cash-flow ratio – operating cash flow divided by revenue.  
8. Asset-turnover ratio – revenue divided by total assets.

D. SAFETY  
9. Net debt to EBITDA – total debt minus cash, then divided by EBITDA.  
10. Interest-coverage ratio – operating income divided by the absolute value of interest expense.  
11. Current ratio – current assets divided by current liabilities.

E. VALUATION  
12. PEG – share price divided by forward EPS, then divided by the EPS growth rate (calculated only when EPS growth is positive).  
13. Free-cash-flow yield – free cash flow divided by market capitalisation (share price times shares outstanding).

II. SCORING AND RANKING PROCESS  

1.  Download financial statements and prices, store them in SQLite, and compute the thirteen metrics above.

2.  Handle gaps and outliers  
    • Any missing figure is filled with the median figure for the same industry; if the industry has fewer than five companies, use the market-wide median instead.  
    • Extreme values beyond the 5th and 95th percentiles are pulled back to those limits.

3.  Convert raw numbers to 0-to-100 scores  
    • Rank each metric within its industry and express the ranking as a percentile.  
    • For “lower-is-better” items (Net debt / EBITDA and PEG) subtract the percentile from one hundred so that higher is always better.

4.  Blend growth items  
    • For each of the four growth items, blend its FY score and Q-Seq score using forty percent FY and sixty percent Q-Seq.

5.  Build each pillar score  
    • Growth score = 50 % revenue + 30 % EPS + 10 % free cash flow + 10 % gross margin (all using the blended values).  
    • Quality, Efficiency, Safety, Valuation scores are simple averages of their own sub-metrics.

6.  Total Score  
    Total Score = 45 % Growth + 20 % Quality + 10 % Efficiency + 15 % Safety + 10 % Valuation.
