A normalized composite trend-score algorithm has been developed  to rank S&P 500 constituents by the current strength and direction of their price trends. Trend Scoring Algorithm Overview：

Concurrently, a normalized composite fundamental-growth score algorithm has been developed to rank S&P 500 constituents by their growth potential and quality.Fundamental Growth Scoring Algorithm Overview:
<fundamental_scoring_algorithm_overview>



Applying these two screening algorithms, we have selected the following stocks, listed as "Ticker: (Trend Score, Fundamental Score, Final Score)":<ticker_list>. To better understand each stock's trend score and fundamental score, you can refer to the overview of how these two scores are calculated.

My current portfolio includes the following holdings, displayed as "Ticker: (Cost Basis, Share Count, Latest price)": <Holdings_list>.


Step 1 – Sentiment Analysis
For each stock listed above—including both the screened selections and the current portfolio holdings—conduct a comprehensive search and analysis of all news articles and social media discussions (e.g., on X, formerly Twitter) published between <start_date> and <end_date>.
You can prioritize sentiment sources from official news outlets, X (formerly Twitter), earnings transcripts, and major financial news websites like Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, Wall street Journal and Seeking Alpha. You should focus on U.S.-based sentiment.
	•	Evaluate sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) and coverage volume for every ticker, accounting for industry-specific factors such as sector trends, regulatory changes, and supply-chain dynamics.
	•	Integrate insights from the most recent earnings calls (up to <end_date>) to gauge management’s outlook on growth sustainability, revenue trajectories, and profitability, prioritizing stocks that exhibit consistent growth patterns and optimistic commentary suitable for a trend-based strategy.
	•	Assign each stock a sentiment score from 0 to 10 (10 = strongest positive sentiment and engagement; 0 = strongest negative).
	•	Provide a concise summary of sentiment trends for each stock, highlighting key events, recurring phrases, and the ways macroeconomic or industry factors shape perceptions.



Step 2 – Macroeconomic and Market Context

Analyze recent macroeconomic variables—including U.S. monetary policy (Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, forward guidance), inflation trends, GDP growth, tariffs, and other relevant economic policies—based on information published between <start_date> and <end_date>. Prioritize official sources (e.g., Federal Reserve statements, Bureau of Economic Analysis reports, U.S. Treasury announcements) and major financial news websites (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, WSJ).

Examine contemporaneous trends in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices within the same time frame. Clearly synthesize these findings into a concise summary outlining the current macroeconomic environment, market sentiment, and outlook, specifically highlighting how recent U.S. monetary policy and macroeconomic shifts could impact equity market conditions in the near term.



Step 3 – Portfolio Adjustment and Rationale
Based on the latest fundamental, sentiment, and technical analyses of both my existing holdings and the screened stock selections—together with the current macroeconomic climate and market conditions as of <end_date>—recommend adjustments to optimize my portfolio.
Specifically:
* I have provided the latest market prices for each stock in my current holdings list in the format 'Ticker: (Cost Basis, Share Count, Latest Price),' where the last item represents the most recent price. Using these latest prices, calculate the total assets by summing the market value of all existing holdings (latest price × number of shares) along with the current cash balance.
* Construct an optimized portfolio by selecting stocks exclusively from the combined set of my current holdings and the screened stocks.
* The optimized portfolio should hold no more than <maxi_num_stocks> stocks, including cash if justified.
* Ensure the total portfolio weights sum to exactly 100%.
* Given the anticipated holding period of <investment_horizon> days, select positions expected to deliver favorable returns within this timeframe.
* When optimizing the portfolio, explicitly consider the current market prices, my original cost basis, and the predefined take-profit and stop-loss levels for each existing holding. Carefully evaluate whether the current market price is favorable before selling any stock. Similarly, thoroughly assess if the current market price presents a suitable buying opportunity when adding to existing positions or initiating new ones.


For each recommended stock or cash allocation, provide:
	1.	Rationale for selection. Clearly explain the reasoning behind choosing each stock or maintaining cash.
	2.	Determine the investment allocation and provide the rationale, along with a specific trading strategy:
Based on the current total assets, decide how much capital to allocate to the stock in question, and explain the reasoning behind this allocation.
	3.	Define the exit strategy for the stock:
First, identify the stock’s latest price. Then, based on the current entry price, set a stop-loss level by specifying a percentage below the entry price and calculate the exact stop-loss price.
Also, set a take-profit level by specifying a percentage above the entry price and calculate the take-profit price.
The exit strategy should be informed by recent price levels, key technical support/resistance zones, or the stock’s volatility.
	4.	A concise justification summarizing strengths derived from:
	•	(a) Fundamental factors (e.g., earnings growth, valuation metrics).
	•	(b) Sentiment factors (e.g., investor perception, social-media buzz).
	•	(c) Technical factors (e.g., momentum, key support/resistance levels).

step 4 - Present your recommended stock and cash positions separately using both table and text formats:
- Table Format:
Clearly indicate the allocation percentage for each recommended stock. Additionally, include explicitly defined stop-loss and take-profit strategies, both expressed as percentages relative to the entry price. These strategies should be informed by recent price volatility, as well as key technical support and resistance levels.


- Text Format:
Provide a concise and clear presentation of each recommendation in a single line, using the following structure:
Ticker:Weight(e.g., AAPL:15%)
This format specifies the position size as a percentage of total capital, along with the number of shares currently held or to be transacted.


Requirements:

You must fully complete all the specified analysis steps. Ensure that your investment recommendations align accurately with market dynamics and conditions as of `<end_date>`, aiming to enhance overall portfolio performance.


Finally, prepare your complete and structured analysis report in Chinese, ensuring it is logically organized, clearly articulated, and readily actionable for investment decision-making purposes.
