BJECTIVE  
Measure the short- to medium-term price momentum of every S&P 500 stock and output a 0-to-100 **Trend Score**.  The score blends ten technical signals that cover price structure, momentum, relative strength and volume confirmation, then ranks all tickers from strongest to weakest.

I. CORE METRICS AND HOW EACH IS CALCULATED  

Daily OHLCV data come from Yahoo Finance and are stored in SQLite; every metric below is refreshed each evening.

1. **Moving-average structure** – checks whether the 10-, 20-, 50- and 150-day simple moving averages (SMAs) are in strict bullish order (10 > 20 > 50 > 150).  
   • Score: 0 / 33 / 67 / 100 depending on how many of the three upward gaps are in place.

2. **50-day SMA slope** – linear-regression slope of the 50-day SMA over the last 20 trading days, divided by the current 50-day SMA to express it as a unit-free percentage.  
   • The result is mapped so a steep positive slope approaches 100 and a steep negative slope approaches 0.

3. **ADX (14-day)** – Average Directional Index taken straight from price highs, lows and closes.  
   • ADX of 15 or below scores 0; ADX 40 or above scores 100; linear in between.

4. **Rate-of-Change (ROC)** – 20-day percentage change in the closing price.  
   • 0 % is worth 50 points; +20 % maps to 100; –20 % maps to 0.

5. **RSI (14-day)** – Relative Strength Index.  
   • The closer RSI is to the neutral 50 line, the higher the score (peaks and troughs are penalised).

6. **MACD histogram slope** – regression slope of the MACD histogram over the last 20 days, normalised by the histogram’s own standard deviation.

7. **Relative strength versus the S&P 500** – excess return of the stock over SPY during the past 63 trading days.  
   • +20 % excess return scores 100; –20 % scores 0.

8. **OBV slope** – regression slope of On-Balance Volume over the last 20 days, again normalised by its standard deviation.

9. **Distance to 52-week high** – percentage the latest close sits below the one-year high.  
   • At the high (0 %) the score is 100; 20 % below the high scores 0.

10. **Volume surge ratio** – 20-day average volume divided by the 120-day average.  
    • The base-10 logarithm of the ratio is scaled so a clear pickup in turnover moves the score toward 100.

II. SCORING AND RANKING PROCESS  

1. **Data update**  
   • Prices and volumes are pulled or back-filled only for dates missing in the database (incremental update).  
   • Moving averages, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, volume averages, Stochastic %K/%D and OBV are recomputed for every ticker.  
   • Additional one-off series—ADX, 52-week high/low and 20-day ROC—are stored alongside daily data.

2. **Raw-to-score mapping**  
   • Each raw metric is transformed onto a 0-to-100 scale using the mapping rules listed under “Core Metrics”.  
   • Outliers are clipped so all scores stay between 0 and 100.

3. **Weighting**  
   Default weights (editable in *config_trend.ini*; they normalise to 100):  
   * Moving-average structure 15  
   * 50-day SMA slope 10  
   * ADX 15  
   * ROC 10  
   * RSI 5  
   * MACD-histogram slope 10  
   * Relative strength 10  
   * OBV slope 10  
   * Distance to 52-week high 10  
   * Volume surge ratio 5  

4. **Trend Score**  
   • Multiply each metric score by its weight, sum the results and divide by 100.
